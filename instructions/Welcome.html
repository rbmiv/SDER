<p>
    Now that the experiment has begun, we ask that you do not communicate with other participants. If you have any
    questions after we finish reading the instructions, please raise your hand and the experimenter will answer your
    question in private.
</p>

<div class="instructions-subheading">Privacy</div>
<p>
    This experiment is structured so that no one, including the experimenters or the other participants, will ever
    know your personal decision or money earnings in the experiment. This is accomplished by giving you the only key
    to a numbered mailbox that contains a sealed envelope with your earnings inside.
</p>
<p>
    This experiment is structured so that no one, including the experimenters, the monitor, and the other subjects
    will ever know the personal decision of anyone in the experiment. Every person's privacy is guaranteed because
    neither his/her name nor student ID number will appear on any form that records decisions in this experiment.
</p>

<div class="instructions-subheading">One Round</div>
<p>
    There will be one decision task in this experiment. You will face the decision task only once, so you should
    take it seriously.
</p>

<div class="instructions-subheading">Random Matching and Anonymity</div>
<p>
    You will be randomly matched with 3 other people to form a group of 4 individuals that will stay the same for
    the entire decision task.
</p>

<div class="instructions-subheading">Cash Payoffs</div>
<p>
    Your earnings in this experiment are expressed in <i><span class="ecu">Experimental Currency Units</span></i>,
    which we will refer to as
    <b><span class="ecu">ECUs</span></b>. At the conclusion of the experiment you will be paid in U.S. dollars using a conversion
        rate of <b>$1 for every {{exchange_rate}} ECU{{if exchange_rate != 1}} 's {{endif}}</b>
        of earnings from the experiment.
